// 2) Given a undirected graph with weights, return the sum of the weight of each path between two nodes (shortest path between two vertices). Assume there are no cycles. 

// Example:


// Input:
//        A
//        | 1
//        B
//    2 /   \ 3
//     C     D
    
// Output:
// 18
// since 
// A to B has weight 1
// A to C has weight 3
// A to D has weight 4
// B to C has weight 2
// B to D has weight 3
// C to D has weight 5
